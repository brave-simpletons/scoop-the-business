## What is Scoop

Scoop is a command-line installer for windows and will let you install the tools you know and love

### What is a "Bucket" for Scoop

A "bucket" is simply a repository of applications that are shared to be known and installed using the Scoop cli

### Does the applications are updated periodically

YES... We use an GitHub actions that execute many times a day to finds all the newest application versions available and updates the bucket.

## Installing Scoop and use our "Bucket"

> :memo:
>
> Make sure PowerShell 5 (or later, include PowerShell Core) and .NET Framework 4.5 (or later) are installed
>
> :memo:

It's really easy to install and configure Scoop to use our bucket. Just follow the code

```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -scope CurrentUser
Invoke-Expression (New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString('https://get.scoop.sh')

scoop bucket add business 'https://github.com/brave-simpletons/scoop-the-business.git'
```

> :warning:
> If you do not have 'Git' installed, you will received this error : "Git is required for buckets"
> The solution is simple, install Git using the next command:
>
> ```powershell
> scoop install git
> ```
>
> And now, you can retry the previous command: `scoop bucket add business 'https://github.com/brave-simpletons/scoop-the-business.git'`

## Using scoop

### Getting help

The help is already included in the CLI

```powershell
scoop help
```

For more information, you can also read this [Scoop Guide](https://scoop.netlify.app/)

### Searching an app

Sure, you could search our GitHub repo... But it could be more easier and faster to use the CLI :wink:

```powershell
# scoop search app-name app-name2 [...]
scoop search 7zip vscode
```

### Installing/Uninstall an application

When you know what app to install:

```powershell
# scoop install app-name app-name2 [...]
scoop install 7zip vscode
```

When you know what app to uninstall:

```powershell
# scoop uninstall app-name app-name2 [...]
scoop uninstall 7zip vscode
```

### Updating

Updating scoop itself and the buckets

```powershell
scoop update
```

Updating specific application(s)

```powershell
#scoop update app-name app-name2 [...]
scoop update 7zip vscode
```

### Cleaning the old app versions

Since the app can be installed separately, sometimes you could have a lot of version. It could be a good idea to done some cleanup using:

```powershell
#scoop cleanup app-name app-name2 [...]
scoop cleanup 7zip vscode
```

Also you could clean the cache of the downloaded application for a specific app or for all

```powershell
#scoop cache rm app-name [or *]
scoop cache rm 7zip

#scoop cache rm *
```

## What Apps that 'scoop-the-business' suggests
